# 1000 Genomes Project - Chile ðŸ‘‹

**Sequencing Chile**

Genomics studies the DNA composition and structure of living organisms. Sequencing is the process of determining the order of DNA's basic components, unique to each species and individual. This provides insights into an organism's genes, biological functions, adaptation to environments, and evolutionary relationships.

### Why Sequence Chilean Species?
Chile hosts unique ecosystems, with species adapted to conditions found nowhere else. However, human intervention and climate change threaten this biodiversity. By sequencing Chilean genomes, we can understand genetic traits that drive species' evolution and resilience. This is essential for conservation efforts, population recovery, and genetic improvement programs for agriculture, aquaculture, and livestock. It also helps identify microorganisms with potential industrial or pharmaceutical applications, and pathogens before they emerge as pandemics.

### Chilean Genomes
Several genome sequencing projects are already underway in Chile, including table grapes, Atlantic salmon, potatoes, and various penguins, desert plants, and microorganisms. Chile has the necessary technologies, researchers, and infrastructure, such as supercomputers, to sequence and interpret genomic data.

### Repository Purpose
This repository stores workflows used to assemble, annotate, and analyze genomes generated by the 1000 Genomes Project - Chile. It covers tools and pipelines for handling data types such as:

- **Nanopore**: Long-read sequencing for high-accuracy genome assembly.
- **Hi-C**: Chromosome conformation capture data to improve genome scaffolding.
- **WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing)**: High-depth, short-read sequencing for base-level resolution.
- **Transcriptome**: RNA sequencing to profile gene expression.

This ensures data processing is reproducible and transparent throughout the project.

Current tools and workflows are described in detail [here](https://github.com/1000GCh/1000G_workflows)
